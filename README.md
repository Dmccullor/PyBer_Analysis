# PyBer_Analysis
An analysis of rideshare data.
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to break down the average fares, drivers and rides by the type of city: Urban, Suburban and Rural. These data can be used to make financial decisions concerning the rideshare company PyBer.

## Results
There are quite a few differences between the types of cities. Although it is very intuitive, the data seem to indicate that the more dense the population of a city, the more activity on PyBer. Urban cities had nearly 3 times the rides of suburban cities and exactly 13 times the rides of rural cities. With the increase in rides there is also an increase in drivers. In fact, the increase in drivers for urban cities appears to be disproportionate to the number of rides. So much so, that the average fare for drivers in urban cities is considerably lower than average for for drivers in rural cities.

## Summary
Based on the data there are large disparities between rural, suburban and urban cities. The rural cities need the most boost so, perhaps a discount for riders would help to boost the number of customers. Once they get to experience the convenience of a PyBer ride, they are sure to become a more frequent user. The lack of activity could also be due to the low number of drivers in these areas. A one-time sign-on bonus could help to incentivize more drivers to enter the fleet. The average fare for these drivers seem to be fairly high, so the earning potential will keep drivers on the road for more of the time. The number of suburban rides are far below that of the urban rides, but still have the benefit of a higher concentration of people than rural areas have. A refer-a-friend program could be effective in driving up demand in suburban areas.
